    <h3 class="ui-accordion-header"><a href="#">Is it safe to give this site my Online Scout Manager password?</a></h3>
    <div class="ui-accordion-content">
      <p>Yes. Your email address and password are not stored on this site. They are used to confirm your identity to OSM in order to gain a user id and secret which are then used to access OSM on your behalf.</p>

    <h3 class="ui-accordion-header"><a href="#">Does Online Scout Manager Extender use cookies (and what are they anyway)?</a></h3>
    <div class="ui-accordion-content">
      <p>Cookies are small text files stored on you computer, they are small parcels of data which a web server gives to a web browser, the browser then sends them back to the server which each request. Since the browser makes a new connection to the server each time you load a page cookies allow the server to keep track of who is viewing a page.</p>
      <p>This is how OSMX uses cookies - when you signin a random number is generated and sent to your browser as a cookie as well as being stored on the server, this number allows the server to check sho you are currently signed in as. These cookies are set to expire (i.e. be deleted) when your browser is closed.</p>
      <p>OSMX also uses services from other providers which set cookies, these are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/policy">Google ReCAPTCHA</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can find out more about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="ui-accordion-header"><a href="#">How does Online Scout Manager Extender store passwords?</a></h3>
    <div class="ui-accordion-content">
      <p>When you create your account or change you password the password you provide is combined with a newly generated salt (collection of random characters) and hashed (encrypted in such a way as it can&#39;t be decrypted) and stored with the salt in the database. When you signin the password you provided is combined with the salt retreived from the database and hashed, the result is compared with the contents of the database. This ensures that not even people with access to the database can see what your password is, there is no way to recover it which is why when you&#39;ve forgotten your password you are required to create a new one.</p
      <p>You can find out more about why this is done by visiting <a href="http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm">crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="ui-accordion-header"><a href="#">How do I pick a good password?</a></h3>
    <div class="ui-accordion-content">
      <p>A good password is one which a cracker needs to spend a lot of time on - every password can be cracked given enough time. The first thing is not to use a word in the dictionary (even if some letters are replaced by numbers) as crackers will try these first, when this fails crackers have no choice but to actually guess every combination of letters and numbers. Once the crackers have to resort to guessing every combination the secret is to make the pool of possible password as large as possible, this can be done by having a long password or password with a lot of different types of characters (upper case, lower case, numbers and punctuation).</p>

    <h3 class="ui-accordion-header"><a href="#">What&#x27;s the OSM permissions page?</a></h3>
    <div class="ui-accordion-content">

    <h3 class="ui-accordion-header"><a href="#">What&#x27;s the Email lists feature?</a></h3>
    <div class="ui-accordion-content">
      <p>The Email lists feature allows you to create a list of email addresses (which you can then copy-paste into your email). You can select which of the four email fields in OSM to include and some basic selection criteria.</p>
      <p>Simply tick off the email fields you&#39;d like to get the email addresses from and use the drop down boxes to choose which email addresses to get. For example &quot;for members who are not in the leaders&quot; would give you all youth members.</p>
      <p>After retreiving the list of email addresses you&#39;ll be able to save the list for future reuse. Saving the list saves the criteria used for generating it, not the actual email addresses.</p>

You can optionally enter the address of your meeting place for inclusion on the map (it is shown by a light green pin with a star inside). If more than one member lives at the same address then the number of members at that address appears in the pin. If the pin is light blue then the members at a shared address are not in the same grouping.</p>
      <p>The location of the addresses are gathered from Google&#39;s geocoding service, the minimum detail the address needs should be streey address and either town or postcode (e.g. &#39;12 Some Street, Some town&#39; or &#39;123 Some Lane, AB34 5FG&#39;).</p>
