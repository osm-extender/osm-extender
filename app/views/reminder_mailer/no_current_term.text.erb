Whilst trying to prepare your email reminder for <%= @reminder.section_name %> an error occured- you can't access data in the section.
This is a problem because when we ask OSM for data for your section we need to tell OSM what term we want the details for. Since today is not in a term we couldn't work out what term to give to OSM. Please correct this by following the instructions below.

* Login to <%= link_to 'OSM', 'https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk' %>.
* Make sure you are using the <%= @task.section_name %> section.
* From the term selector choose "Configure terms".
<%- if @next_term.nil? && @last_term.nil? %>
* Add some terms.
<%- elsif @next_term.nil? %>
* Add a term after <%= @last_term.name %> or change its finish date.
<%- elsif @last_term.nil? %>
* Add a term before <%= @next_term.name %> or change its start date.
<%- else %>
* Remove the gap between <%= @last_term.name %> and <%= @next_term.name %> by either:
  * Making <%= @last_term.name %> finish on <%= ordinalized_date((@next_term.start - 1), "%d of %b %Y") %>
  * Making <%= @next_term.name %> start on <%= ordinalized_date((@last_term.finish + 1), "%d of %b %Y") %>
  * Changing the finish date of <%= @last_term.name %> and the start date of <%= @next_term.name %> so there is no gap between them.
<%- end %>
